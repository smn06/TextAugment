## TextAugment: Empowering NLP with Self-Supervised Text Data Augmentation

![TextAugment Logo](link/to/logo.png)

## Overview

TextAugment is a powerful tool designed to enhance Natural Language Processing (NLP) models by leveraging self-supervised learning techniques for textual data augmentation. This repository provides a flexible and easy-to-use framework for generating diverse and contextually relevant augmented data, thereby improving the robustness and performance of your NLP models.
